# A Lifelong Passion for Capturing Moments

Photography has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. What started as a childhood curiosity has evolved into both a personal passion and a professional skill—a way to see the world differently and preserve moments that matter.

## Finding My Focus

Over time, I've gravitated toward three genres that speak to me: **nature**, **cities/architecture**, and **portrait photography**. Each offers something unique—the raw beauty of landscapes, the energy and geometry of urban environments, and the intimate connection of capturing someone's essence through a lens.

## The Tools of the Trade

I've always been a **Nikon** photographer, drawn to their reliability and image quality. In recent years, I've expanded my toolkit to include **analog film cameras** and a **Polaroid instant film camera**. There's something special about how deliberate film makes you—every frame counts, and the process becomes as important as the result.

## From Hobby to Professional Work

At **unlimited.studio**, photography has become a part of my professional work. I handle **portrait and team photoshoots**. Beyond that, I also handle **product photography**—both in studio environments and on location—covering everything from small accessories to large furniture pieces. The full **post-production and editing process** is part of my craft, ensuring every image tells the right story.

## A Personal Archive

This gallery is a collection of my favorite shots—moments captured across different places, times, and formats. A visual diary showcasing not just technical skill, but a way of seeing and appreciating the world around us.
