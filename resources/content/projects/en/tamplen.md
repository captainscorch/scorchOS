# Precision in Every Pixel

Dr. Tamplen is a nationally recognized (USA) Rhinoplasty Specialist known for his published techniques and meticulous approach. Since early 2022, I've led Dr. Tamplen's digital presence through unlimited.studio — from the initial website redesign to ongoing performance marketing. In 2025, we launched a comprehensive refresh to ensure the site continues to stand out in a highly competitive industry.

## Designed for Trust & Conversion

The aesthetic reflects Dr. Tamplen's philosophy: **natural results that enhance, never overpower**. The design is elegant, modern, and intentionally premium — featuring a navigation with a golden, semi-translucent blurred background and mega menus for a high-end feel, smooth page scroll transitions, and carefully selected fade-in animations throughout.

- **Fixed Bottom CTA Bar:** On desktop, key facts and a persistent call-to-action keep conversion paths always visible
- **Location-Aware Experience:** Users select their preferred location in the masthead area, which persists via local storage and dynamically adjusts all navigation links and URLs
- **Contact Forms Everywhere:** Every page includes a contact form, to enhance user experience and maximize lead capture

## Multi-Location SEO Architecture

With three practice locations across Arizona and California, SEO was a core focus. I built a **structured sitemap with clear hierarchy** where each primary procedure exists as three separate location-specific pages, optimized for local search intent.

- **Full Schema.org Implementation:** Comprehensive structured data markup across all pages — MedicalBusiness, Physician, FAQPage, Article, and BreadcrumbList schemas for maximum search visibility
- **Meta Tag Optimization:** Dynamic, page-specific meta titles, descriptions, and Open Graph tags — including custom OG images tailored to each procedure and location
- **Location-Specific Content:** Tailored copy and meta data for Scottsdale, Orinda, and San Diego
- **FAQ Sections:** Each procedure and location page includes structured FAQ content for rich snippets
- **Patient Detail Pages:** Individual before/after entries have their own URLs for sharing and SEO-optimized content

## Performance-optimized Before/After Gallery

In plastic surgery, before/after galleries are everything. I engineered a gallery system capable of handling **hundreds of high-resolution images** without significantly sacrificing page speed:

- **Lazy Loading & Optimization:** Images load on-demand with optimized compression
- **Filtering System:** Users can filter by procedure type for relevant results
- **Gallery + Slider Hybrid:** A seamless combination allowing both browsing and focused viewing
- **Improved Lighthouse Scores:** The rebuild dramatically improved Core Web Vitals for better search rankings

## Google Ads & Conversion Funnels

Beyond the main site, I developed **dedicated funnel pages** for Google Ads campaigns, including specialized landing pages for travel patients. Every page is built with conversion in mind — clean CTAs, trust signals, and optimized load times.
