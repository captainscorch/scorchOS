# A Small Solution to a Big Problem

1 in 5 people deal with dry mouth every day. Loz delivers pocket-sized relief with medical-grade, all-natural lozenges — and the e-commerce experience needed to match that bold promise.

## Brutalist by Design

I developed the theme from the ground up and led the design direction. The aesthetic is intentionally **brutalist, bold, and colorful** — stripped of fluff, packed with personality. Every pixel reinforces the brand's direct, no-nonsense approach to oral care.

## A Custom, Interactive Product Experience

The product detail page is engineered for engagement. On desktop, it features a **50/50 split layout** where the left media area stays sticky as users scroll through benefits and reviews on the right — a unique, engaging feel that keeps the product front and center.

- **Gesture-Based Media Slider:** Product images swipe through like Stories, feeling native to a mobile-first audience.
- **Custom Reviews Integration:** A fully customized reviews app showcasing **video and image reviews** from real customers.
- **Dynamic Lozenge Icon:** A custom "drop" illustration updates in real-time to display the lozenge count based on selected variant and quantity.

## Logic-Driven Subscription Flow

The purchase flow is engineered for conversion:

- **Variant Selection:** Users choose between 7 or 30 ct. variant and 1-pack or 2-pack, with inline +/- quantity controls nested inside the 2-pack option.
- **Order Frequency Toggle:** One-time purchase or monthly subscription, seamlessly integrated with **ReCharge**.
- **Animated Discount Bars:** Two progress bars animate to show free shipping eligibility and tiered discounts (e.g., 20% off for monthly 2-pack orders).
- **Custom Cart Icon:** The cart icon visually fills with more lozenge "drops" as quantity increases — a satisfying micro-interaction.

## URLs & Marketing Infrastructure

Every variant and frequency combination has its own **custom product URL**, enabling precise attribution for ad campaigns. The store is wired for growth with **Klaviyo** for email flows and the **Shopify Marketing app** for newsletter capture.
