# Building a Foodtruck Discovery Platform

way.food is a new comparison portal for foodtrucks, caterers, and party services — currently focused on the DACH region with plans to expand worldwide. As project lead, I was responsible and helped shape the product strategy, contributed to investor pitches, and served as the primary point of contact. My team at **unlimited** supported the startup across everything, from the initial brand identity to marketing and social media management. My core focus: owning the entire technical architecture, from strategy, system design and DevOps to payment infrastructure and full-stack development to managing the newsletter and performance marketing.

## Infrastructure at Scale

I architected a **production-grade server infrastructure** designed for growth:

- **Multi-environment setup:** Separate servers for development, staging, and production
- **CI/CD pipeline:** Automated deployments with zero-downtime releases
- **Load balancing:** Distributed traffic handling for high-demand periods
- **Database architecture:** Dedicated database servers with automated backups
- **S3 integration:** Static media handling and scheduled backups to AWS S3
- **Full Stripe integration:** Complete payment processing via Laravel Cashier with subscription management, webhooks, and multiple pricing tiers

## The Core Product

At the heart of way.food is a **dynamic, interactive map** powered by **Mapbox GL JS**. Users can search by location, filter by cuisine type, and browse provider profiles — complete with menus, photos, reviews, and availability calendars.

Key user features include:

- **Public open tenders:** Users can post event requests; providers apply directly
- **Provider profiles:** Rich media galleries, menus, reviews, and instant contact
- **Smart search:** Location-based filtering with real-time results

## Provider Experience

Providers enjoy a **guided multi-step onboarding** flow, followed by subscription selection. The custom-built backend allows:

- **Multi-profile management:** One user can manage multiple foodtrucks or catering services
- **Booking request handling:** Accept, decline, and communicate with customers
- **Availability management:** Calendar-based scheduling and blocked dates
- **Profile customization:** Menus, galleries, service areas, and more

## Tech Stack & Monitoring

Built on **Laravel** with **Livewire** for reactive components and **Alpine.js** for lightweight interactivity. **Tailwind CSS** ensures a consistent, responsive design. The admin panel runs on **Filament**, and AI features leverage the **OpenAI** API integration.

For reliability, I integrated **Sentry** and **Laravel Nightwatch** for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring.

## The Results

way.food has scaled to:

- **1,000+ registered users**
- **300+ verified providers**
- **Thousands of booking requests**
- **7-figure annual traffic**

A platform built for scale, proving that startup speed and enterprise-grade architecture aren't mutually exclusive.
