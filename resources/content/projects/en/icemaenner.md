# High Voltage Commerce

ICEMÄNNER isn't just about selling ice; it's about a lifestyle. As Co-founder and Lead Web Dev at **unlimited.studio**, I led the technical realization of ICEMÄNNER's vision, turning a viral brand into a high-performance e-commerce experience.

## Custom Theme Architecture

The theme was developed and designed from the ground up by us. It incorporates custom illustrations, animations, and specialized scroll effects to balance high-res assets with fast performance, creating an immersive brand experience.

## Automated Inventory Logic

To bridge complexity with simplicity, we utilized Shopify Flow for advanced variant warehouse processing and complex discount logic.

- **Smart Inventory:** We implemented a system where 50-packs are essentially 5x 10-packs sharing the same SKU.
- **Storefront Integration:** Custom logic in the theme and storefront handles these relationships, ensuring stock accuracy and automated fulfillment while keeping the customer experience seamless.

## Integrated B2B Portal

Behind the scenes, a robust B2B portal serves retail partners with gated access and separate payment gateways, proving that a store can look "TikTok famous" while running like a Fortune 500 logistics operation.
