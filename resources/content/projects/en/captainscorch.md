# Where Design Meets the Command Line

captainscor.ch is more than a portfolio — it's my creative playground where I merge my love for clean design with my passion for development. The site draws inspiration from my favorite interfaces: the elegance of **macOS**, the raw power of the **command line**, and the fluidity of modern **web applications**.

## The Tech I Love

I built this with my favorite stack: **Laravel** on the backend, **Vue.js** on the frontend, connected seamlessly with **Inertia.js** for a performant SPA experience with smooth page transitions. **Tailwind CSS** handles the styling — my current go-to, though I still have nostalgia for the Bootstrap days.

## A Landing Page That Speaks

The homepage opens with a bold, large-font statement explaining who I am and what I do. Integrated into the text are the logos for **unlimited.studio** (my studio) and **lyftd** (my passion project).

## Bento Grid & Interactive Directory

Below the fold, a **bento grid layout** showcases different areas of the site. The portfolio section displays a fully functional **directory tree structure** — folders can be toggled and expanded, revealing project categories and names, just like you're used to from your operating system.

## Navigation & CMD+K

The top navigation is **fluid and sticky** — my name on the left, a CMD+K trigger on the right, and contextual navigation in the center that adapts based on the current page. The **CMD+K command palette** is fully functional:

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full arrow key and enter support for power users
- **Language Switching:** Toggle between English and German
- **Dark/Light Mode:** With an old-school click sound effect
- **Working Terminal:** An interactive terminal where users can run commands like `ls`, `cd /home`, `cd /portfolio`, and `help` to navigate the site via CLI

## Full i18n & Preferences

- **Auto Language Detection:** The site detects user language preferences from OS-level settings
- **Persistent Preferences:** Dark mode is default, but light mode preferences are saved to local storage

## Error Pages as Art

All error pages are designed experiences. Every error page — 404, 500, 503, and beyond — **simulates a terminal window** complete with a draggable header, macOS-style window controls, and a fully interactive command prompt. Users can type commands like `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, and `help`. It's an error page you actually want to find.

## About Page Flexibility

The about page features an adaptive bio section where users can **adjust text length** with plus/minus toggles, or switch between three view modes: prose, list, or timeline graph. The timeline can be filtered by company. Skills are displayed as **categorized tags** spanning design tools, code languages, and technologies. Alternatively, a skills modal displays my technical abilities as a **formatted JavaScript file** — because why not.

## Portfolio: Books on a Shelf

The case study overview offers two distinct views: a **book cover-inspired grid gallery**, or a **spine view** where colorful book spines (based on the brand colors) stack from the bottom of the page, as if looking at a bookshelf from the front. Each view is designed to feel unique.

## Case Study Experience

Individual case studies feature a modern **Swiper.js gallery** with automatic aspect ratio handling, video autoplay, and a drawer that opens and scrolls to the clicked image. The story preview text uses a **typing effect** that brings each case study to life.

## Blog: Markdown + Frontmatter

Posts are plain **markdown files** with YAML frontmatter for metadata — parsed with **gray-matter** and fed into a small composable. One file per post keeps content and metadata together, making it easy to edit — all without a CMS.

## A Living Playground

This site is never finished. It's where I experiment with new techniques, push creative boundaries, and showcase not just what I've built — but how I think.
