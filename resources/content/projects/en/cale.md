# Scandinavian Simplicity at Scale

cale design approached my team at **unlimited.studio** before the brand even existed. We helped shape their identity and build everything from scratch — from brand strategy to a complete digital presence. The result is a modern brand for premium furniture, minimalist interiors, and home accessories, all crafted in their own manufactory. This case study focuses on the website and photography: the challenge was to build a digital storefront that honors this craftsmanship while handling a massive, diverse catalog.

## Clean by Design

The aesthetic is **minimalist and Scandinavian-inspired** — every element stripped back to essentials. A custom icon family was developed specifically for product and collection categories, creating a cohesive visual language across the entire store.

## 800+ Products, Zero Compromise

With **800+ products** spanning furniture, candles, textiles, and accessories, this isn't a boutique shop — it's a full-scale operation. Each product type demanded its own approach:

- **Custom Metafields:** Extensive use of metafields to make every product page unique — feature highlights with matching icons, detailed spec tables, expandable accordions, and more.
- **Interactive 3D Renders:** Select products feature **3D models (via three.js)**, letting customers explore pieces from every angle before buying.
- **AI-Generated Environments:** Leveraging **generative AI and SOTA models** to place products in diverse lifestyle settings — scaling product photography without the need for endless physical shoots.

## Photography & Post-Production

Beyond development, I handled **product photography and post-editing** — ensuring visual consistency across the entire catalog and to create assets that convert.

## Omnichannel Infrastructure

This project goes far beyond the online store:

- **Shopify POS:** Full integration and setup at the local showroom, including hardware installation and staff training.
- **Complex Shipping Logic:** Handling everything from standard parcels to **freight items** with differentiated pricing and Hermes integration.
- **German Invoice Compliance:** A custom app ensures proper invoice generation for German customers.

## Performance Marketing & Growth

I also managed the **performance marketing stack** — integrating Google, Meta, TikTok, and Pinterest tracking, plus full **Google Shopping** setup for maximum product visibility. Early on, we provided **strategic consulting** to help shape the brand's digital vision and roadmap.
