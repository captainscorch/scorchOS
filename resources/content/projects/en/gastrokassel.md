# Speed Meets Precision

When Dr. med. H. Habibi took over a medical practice, he needed more than just a website — he needed a basic digital identity, and he needed it fast. Patients had to find essential information about the doctor, his qualifications, services offered, and opening times without delay.

## Built from Scratch, Optimized for Speed

With a tight deadline, I built the entire site from the ground up using **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, and **Inertia.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**. Every decision was made with performance in mind — the result is a fast website optimized for both load times and SEO, ensuring patients can find the practice easily through search.

## Brand Identity in a Box

The doctor didn't have an established visual identity, so I created one: a cohesive brand package including a custom **typeface selection**, **color palette**, **icon mark logo**, **favicon**, and proper **meta images** for social sharing. This gave the practice the necessary professional and trustworthy appearance from day one.

## Motion & Interactivity

To elevate the user experience beyond a static medical website, I integrated **VueUse Motion** for smooth on-page-load animations and scroll-based interactions. Since the site is a full Single Page Application powered by Inertia.js, I could also implement seamless **page transitions** — no jarring reloads, just fluid navigation between pages and sections.

## The Result

A modern, fast, and professional web presence that helps patients find the information they need while establishing Dr. Habibi's practice as a trustworthy destination for gastroenterology care.
